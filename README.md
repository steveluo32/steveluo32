### Personal Philosophy

- I enjoy the feeling of earning a living while doing something I love, knowing that it also contributes to my future. I have a strong desire to continuously learn and systemize my knowledge base. 
It's almost like having OCD when it comes to knowledge — I feel a sense of loss if my understanding of something isn't complete or well-organized. My approach to learning is similar to Breadth-First Search (BFS), which I call Breadth-First Learning. I’m not concerned about the depth at first because, over time, BFS will naturally lead to a deeper understanding. 
- I really like to map any knowledge into the real world. I love the SECI knowledge management framework by Ikujiro Nonaka. In his theory, knowledge exists in two forms: 1) Implicit Knowledge, and 2) Explicit Knowledge. They are transformable. We may have a subconscious sense of doing what is right, but we need to articulate it through language.
The evolution of knowledge and wisdom comes not only from translating thoughts into language, but also from moving between subconscious and conscious understanding, and even from subconsciousness to subconsciousness.
- In machine learning, nearly 99% of answers are generated based on probability. 
This means that, with a large enough training dataset and a sufficiently complex model (i.e., large enough partitioned space), the model can produce a highly representative answer in most cases. 
My favorite, however, is reinforcement learning, as it genuinely mimics human-like thinking—approaching goals incrementally based on feedback and strategy optimization. This contrasts with other methods where the focus is on minimizing loss (by optimizing a loss function calculated from training data) to fit the most representative answer.
- Computer Science, especially reinforcement learning, is the science of computing the real world, transforming human life from abstract concepts into numbers. It uses numerical calculations to determine how to make optimal decisions.
Our lives are similar to an agent-based scenario, where we have different starting points, measure happiness as the reward function, efforts as the cost function, and use intuition and logic as the heuristics function, continuously adapting through online learning.
How closely we approach optimal happiness depends on how effectively our heuristics (i.e., intuition and logic) guide our actions.
